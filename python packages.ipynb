    "# Introduction:\n",
    "# The `pycountry` library is a Python package designed to provide information about countries, subdivisions, languages, currencies, and scripts. \n",
    "# It utilizes ISO standards to allow easy access to standardized country data, including country names, alpha-2 codes, alpha-3 codes, numeric codes, languages, currencies, and subdivisions.\n",
    "# This library can be particularly useful in applications where country-related information is required, such as geographic data analysis, \n",
    "# internationalization, and other global data management tasks. By providing a simple and consistent API to access country data, \n",
    "# `pycountry` enables users to integrate this information seamlessly into Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sources:\n",
    "# The data in `pycountry` comes from ISO 3166 (country codes), ISO 639 (languages), and ISO 4217 (currencies) standards, among others.\n",
    "# These data sources are widely recognized and used in various systems for maintaining standardized country information.\n",
    "# `pycountry` makes this data available in an easy-to-access Python object format, which can be particularly useful for developers working with global datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of using pycountry:\n",
    "# 1. Standardized Data: The data provided by `pycountry` follows widely accepted ISO standards (e.g., ISO 3166 for country codes, ISO 4217 for currencies).\n",
    "#    This ensures that the information is globally recognized, consistent, and reliable.\n",
    "# 2. Easy Access to Country Data: `pycountry` simplifies the process of retrieving detailed country data such as alpha-2/alpha-3 codes, names, and currency codes.\n",
    "#    The library abstracts complex data management and presents it in a Pythonic way, making it easy to access country-related information.\n",
    "# 3. Versatility: It is versatile and can be used in various applications such as geographic data analysis, internationalization of software, \n",
    "#    data processing for global applications, and even in web scraping tasks that require country-based filtering.\n",
    "# 4. Open Source: `pycountry` is an open-source library, making it freely available for use, modification, and contribution. \n",
    "#    This promotes collaboration and improvements from the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations of using pycountry:\n",
    "# 1. Static Data: `pycountry` contains static data that does not update automatically. Although it relies on trusted ISO standards, \n",
    "#    the data may become outdated if there are updates to country codes, names, or other details in the underlying standards.\n",
    "#    Users need to manually update the library if they want to keep up with such changes.\n",
    "# 2. Limited Country Subdivision Information: `pycountry` provides country subdivision data, but this is limited and may not cover every country in detail. \n",
    "#    In some cases, it may not include every possible subdivision or administrative division.\n",
    "# 3. No Real-Time Data: It does not provide real-time or dynamic data such as GDP, population statistics, or other real-time metrics that might be important for certain use cases.\n",
    "# 4. Limited Advanced Features: For users who need more complex or detailed geographic or demographic data (e.g., geopolitical relationships, \n",
    "#    historical data, or deeper subdivisions), `pycountry` may not be sufficient and users might need to explore other more specialized libraries or APIs.\n",
